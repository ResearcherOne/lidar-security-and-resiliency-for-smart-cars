# lidar-security-and-resiliency-for-smart-cars
This project aims to increase security and resiliency of smart cars by detecting remote attacks performed on smart cars that make use of LIDAR sensors. Currently, attackers are able to inject fake objects, change distance of objects in range and disrupt LIDAR sensor functioning normally. This project performs real time analysis on LIDAR data to detect attacks. In order to perform detection a machine learning approach is used to create normal behavior of the system in that sense, even new attacks might be detected since it is not based on detecting specific attacks but whether the system is in normal state or not.
